# Getting started

This is a straight forward PHP and Symfony project. All you'll need is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and an IDE,
and you'll be up and running in less than 10 minutes.

1. Have a read of [Our concepts](/doc/concepts.md) to familiarise yourself with our tools and basic abstractions
2. Follow the [Setup guide](/doc/setup.md) to get up and running
3. Take on the [Challenge](/doc/task.md)
